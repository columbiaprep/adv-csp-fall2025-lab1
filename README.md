This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Lab: Working as a Team

By end of class, you must split up the following tasks and divide and conquer. **You may not use AI to complete this lab.**

1. Call-to-Action Alert 
Create an alert box that isn't just for information, but actively encourages a user to perform an action.

HeroUI Components to Use:

Alert: To display the main message (e.g., "Your profile is incomplete!").

Button: For the direct call-to-action (e.g., "Complete Now").

2. Labeled Progress Bar 
Build a progress bar that sits inside a container and includes a title or label to provide context for what the bar represents.

HeroUI Components to Use:

Card: To serve as the container and provide a title area.

Progress: To display the visual progress itself.

3. Profile Avatar with Status 
Design a simple user avatar that includes a status indicator, perfect for showing if a user is online, away, or offline.

HeroUI Components to Use:

Avatar: To display the user's image or initials.

Indicator: To overlay a small colored dot on the avatar representing their status.

4. Simple Confirmation Modal 
Construct a basic modal dialog that asks the user for confirmation and provides "Confirm" and "Cancel" actions.

HeroUI Components to Use:

Modal: To create the dialog window and backdrop.

Button: For the confirmation and cancellation actions.

Of course. Here are two more simple options.

5. Input with Action Button ðŸ”Ž
Create a common UI element that pairs an input field with a button, such as a search bar or a field for submitting a coupon code.

HeroUI Components to Use:

Input: For the text entry field.

Button: For the submit or search action.

Certainly. Here are four more simple component ideas following the same pattern.

6. Notified Action Button ðŸ””
Create a button that includes a badge, typically used to show a count for items in a cart, unread messages, or pending friend requests.

HeroUI Components to Use:

Button: The primary clickable element.

Badge: To display the notification count, positioned on the corner of the button.
