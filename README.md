This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Lab 3: Developing a Component with Props

By end of class, you must create a branch that will have your component on it, and you must submit a pull request of your component. You will modify your existing component to add props. See the props-example.tsx file for the format you should follow.

1. Check that your imports include React
2. Create an Interface with the data you should pass to your prop. This indicates the values and data types of each prop you are passing to the component.
3. Modify the Component's first line to include the `React.FC< >` portion, with the brackets indicating the interface. Additionally, list the parameters (and any default values) into the parentheses.
4. Access the parameters using the curly brace notation seen in the example.


## Lab 2: Adding Styles

By end of class, you must style your component according to the below style guide. Utilize the documentation available at [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes) to help you in your mission. **Choose the same component you started in Lab 1**
